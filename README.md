## Problem Statement

**Regression Analysis of car prices in the US Automobile Market**

An automobile company is planning to enter the US automotive market. As part of their rigorous market research, they would like to get a thorough understanding of the key factors that drive the price of cars in the US. They collected a decent amount of data about the cars that are currently on the market, recording a diverse set of attributes. Create a regression model that can predict the price of a car from a set of selected features, and also analyze how much these features can explain the variations of car prices in the US.
